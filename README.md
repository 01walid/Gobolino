Gobolino
========


Gobolino tries to be a decent, full featured dokcer gui with almost zero configuration and dependencies.
Easy to launch in a python virtual environment, it wants to provide full control over all docker functionalities with the ease that only a gui can provide.



Gobolino is under heavy development rigth now so functionality is expect to change quickly.
